ES6 - New JS standard
 - modules (**check this out) ##Lots of different solutions pre ES6
  - ember uses ES6 style modules
 - Not suported in Browser right now
   - Ember has a transcompiler to ES5
   
Ember uses promises/A+ <--Look this up too
Ember's router is Async
 - router will expect content to be promise
 - rsvp.js <--Promise library

The extensible web manifesto <--Look this up
 - Expose low level apis and build JS APIs on top that are more complex
  - Allows faster turn around than current wait for standards board and vendors

Docker <--Linux deployment containers
